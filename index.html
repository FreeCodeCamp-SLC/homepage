    <p>Welcome to our campsite!  We're an open source community of busy adults who learn to code, then practice by building projects for nonprofits. </p>
    <p>Check out <a href="www.freecodecamp.com/about">www.freecodecamp.com/about</a> to learn more about the project and to join in! </p>
    <p>We meet in person periodically to collaborate, help each other with code, just have fun, have hackathons, attend workshops etc. You can find the date of our next meeting, or just learn more about us by visiting our <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.salt.lake.city/">page </a>on Facebook. </p>
